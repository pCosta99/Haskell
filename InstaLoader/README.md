## My take on a Haskell approach to develop something similar to InstaLoader

You can check out my [blog post](https://pcosta99.github.io/posts/InstaLoader) for a lot more info on why I did this, so here I'll just focus on how you can test it out if you're feeling like it!

## Steps

1. Create an account in [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com), login and get to the [API](https://rapidapi.com/logicbuilder/api/instragram-data1) I used here.
2. Go to **Requests** and change the variable ***key*** to the one you will be provided with.
3. Fire up ghci on **InstaLoader** and there you go, you have ``getUserPictures`` and ``getUserProfilePic`` available to test it out!
4. Expand this up to whatever you feel like! Have fun :heart:
